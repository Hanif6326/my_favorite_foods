        <h2><u>KACCHI BIRYANI - DUM MUTTON BIRYANI</u></h2>
        <P>Kachchi biryani is usually a featured dish for weddings and social gatherings and celebrations.  Layers of meat, rice and potatoes are infused with warm and delectable blends of aromatic spices to prepare kachchi biryani.  Whether it is a tender piece of mutton, potato, alubokhara(prune) or the rice itself, each spoonful is a mouthwatering surprise.I find this grand biryani to have lesser prep time because all the ingredients are put in layers and then in the oven instead of cooking the rice and meat separately and then combining (leaving me with less pots to clean afterwards also).</P>

            <li>Take all the spice from red chili to caraway seed, grind.</li>
            <li>Take the pot where biryani will be cooked. Add the meat and yogurt, ground spice mix, garlic and ginger paste and salt. Marinate for anywhere between 30 minutes to overnight(see notes).</li>
            <li>Steps to prepare the onion:</li>

            <li>Add very thinly sliced onion and sautee until fragrant and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Wash, peel and cut the potato in big chinks. Usually into 3 pieces for a medium Idaho potato.</li>

                Add the rice.</li>

        <h2><u>FUSKA - THE BEST STREET FOOD EVER</u></h2>
        <P>Fuska is the most popular street food in Bangladesh. I bet that every Bangladeshi, who lives in abroad, misses its unique spicy, sour, crispy taste. But we can easily make it at home and enjoy the deshi flavour in abroad. It is a bit long process, if you make the Fuska shell before, it will be less hustle. Only one thing (Talmakhana) will be hard to get in abroad. You can bring it from Bangladesh. Even you can buy readymade Fuska shells from Indian grocery. But I always prefer homemade one.</P>

        <h3><u>Recipe</h3></u>
        <ol>
            <li>First soak Talmakhana in water for 10-15 minutes, then dissolve salt with  Talmakhana’s water, flour and semolina. Knead properly and make smooth dough.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough 6 equal balls and roll ball into  flat thin bread.</li>
            <li>Now cut the bread with cookie cutter. Roll rest of balls same way.</li>
            <li>Place fry pan on medium heat. Don’t make oil too hot. Fry the fuska shells on medium heat otherwise the shells won’t be crisp.</li>
            <li>Soak peas over night and boil with salt.</li>
            <li>Drain peas and mix potato, roasted cumin, chillies, coriander, onion and black salt.</li>
            <li>Soak tamarind half hour with one cup water. Fry the chillies and crush them.</li>
            <li>Add crushed chillies, salt, cumin powder and sugar in tamarind water.</li>
            <li>Now make hole in fuska shells and insert peas stuffing there. Make 8-10 of them and serve in a plate along with tamarind water.</li>
